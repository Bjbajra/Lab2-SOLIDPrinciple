# Lab2-SOLIDPrinciple

In this lab I followed 4 principles of SOLID i.e. SRP, OCP, ISP and DI. In OrderFactory.cs file to reduce the tradicional dependecies from top to bottom
I used Dependency inversion that both High and low level classes should depend on interfaces that expose the behavior needed by higher-level classes. Also
used interface segregation and open closed principle to all classes that it would be easier to do changes in future in application. Tried to apply DRY to 
get rid of repeat codes and KISS to make application simple as possible.
